# 🏨 Smart Hostel Management System (C++)

This is a console-based **Smart Hostel Management System** developed in **C++**, aimed at managing student data within a hostel environment.  
It was created as part of a Programming Fundamentals course to demonstrate the use of **structures**, **arrays**, **pointers**, and **modular programming** in C++.


## 📌 Objective

The goal of this project is to simulate a basic hostel management system that can store and retrieve student records efficiently.  
It introduces the use of **C++ structs** to model real-world entities, and employs **3D pointer arrays** to simulate hostel blocks, floors, and rooms.

The system is built for beginner-level programmers and focuses on practicing:

- Struct-based data management
- Pointer and array handling
- Functional decomposition
- Console input/output
- Conditional logic and menu-driven programming


## 🧱 Project Structure

- **Language:** C++
- **Concepts Used:**
  - `struct` for defining student information
  - Arrays and 3D pointer arrays for hostel layout
  - Pointer manipulation for accessing room data
  - Functions for modular coding
  - Input/output handling via `cin` and `cout`


## 💡 Key Features

✅ **Add Student:**  
Allows the user to assign a student to a specific room based on block, floor, and room number.

✅ **View All Records:**  
Displays all allocated rooms along with the student details.

✅ **Search Functionality:**  
Search for a student by name or room number.

✅ **Room Availability Check:**  
Determine whether a room is vacant or occupied.

✅ **Simple Menu-Driven Interface:**  
Users can select options through a clean CLI menu for ease of use.

✅ **Data Storage with Structs:**  
Each student’s information (name, roll number, department, etc.) is stored in a structured way.


## 📁 How to Run the Project

1. Open the project in any C++ IDE (Code::Blocks, Dev C++, Visual Studio, etc.) or use a terminal-based compiler like `g++`.

2. Compile the code:

3. Run the program:

4. Follow the on-screen menu instructions to add, view, or search student data.


## 🧠 What I Learned

Through building this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

- How to use `structs` for real-world data
- The concept of `pointers` and multi-dimensional arrays
- Breaking down code into smaller, manageable functions
- Working with dynamic memory-like structures in a beginner-friendly context
- Designing basic systems that simulate real-life applications


## 🚫 Limitations

- Data is stored in memory only (no file saving or loading)
- No validation for duplicate entries or input errors
- Designed for a small dataset, not scalable for large hostel networks
